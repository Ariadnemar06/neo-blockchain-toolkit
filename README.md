# Neo Blockchain Toolkit for .NET

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/NGDSeattle/Public/_apis/build/status/ngdseattle.neo-blockchain-toolkit?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/NGDSeattle/Public/_build/latest?definitionId=20&branchName=master)

## Key Benefits

- **Out-of-the-box** : Premium experience with preconfigured toolkit to jump start the development of Smart Contracts
- **One-stop-shop** : Proven libraries and practices to rapidly get Smart Contracts into production
- **One-IDE** : Built-in real world PrivateNet with frictionless edit-build-debug-deployment enhancements to ensure
  consistency across PrivateNet, TestNet and MainNet

## Getting Started

Please see the [Neo Blockchain Toolkit for .NET Quickstart](https://github.com/ngdseattle/neo-blockchain-toolkit/blob/master/quickstart.md)
for instructions on setting up the tools and creating your first Neo smart contract.

## Key Components

### Neo Smart Contract Debugger

- Fully integrated Smart Contract debugging experience inside of Visual Studio Code

### Neo Express

- Real-world PrivateNet - enabling complete end-to-end scenarios for Neo 2.x and Neo 3.0, built on top of the Neo MainNet codebase
- Manage Neo Express for multiple nodes and multiple developers from within Visual Studio Code or using command-line utilities
- Enhanced RPC operations via plugin for developer scenarios. e.g. Snapshot/Rollback/FastForward/Replay etc.

### NeoN Smart Contract Compiler Enhancement

- Enhanced Compiler with metadata to map the source code to byte code and function variables/arguments information etc.
- Create, Edit, Compile, Debug, Test, and Deploy Smart Contracts on both Neo 2.x and Neo 3.0 from within Visual Studio Code

### Smart Contract Templates in .NET languages

- Friction-free templates and guidance for developer productivity
- Real-World production quality Smart Contract Development in minutes

### Neo-FX Library

- Unified Programming Model for a consistent and highly productive developer experience spanning remote, node and contract SDKs.
- Neo-FX will provide a common set of fundamental types (such as large unsigned integers for hash values and elliptic curves for
  cryptography), domain models (such as blocks and transactions) and service abstractions (such as retrieving a transaction or
  invoking a smart contract).
- By using these common set of types across SDKs, developers will be able to move their code between SDKs, ensuring they can run
  their code in the manner that makes most sense for their blockchain application.
